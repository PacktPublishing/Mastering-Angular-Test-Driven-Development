## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter 2.

The code will look like the following:
```
import { PercentPipe } from './percent.pipe';
describe('PercentPipe', () => {
  it('create an instance', () => {
    const pipe = new PercentPipe();
    expect(pipe).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for both experienced Angular developers and junior developers. Tech leads and architects who are responsible for code quality and scalability will also benefit from this book, as well as software development students looking to learn TDD concepts. Whether you're an experienced developer, a junior programmer, or a student, this book will equip you with the necessary knowledge to implement TDD in Angular projects.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).

## Key information
### Chapter 1
Related to Chapter 1, In Chapter 1, you'll notice that I mentioned two files:  `karma.conf.js` and `test.ts`

In new versions of Angular, the two files don't exist and you have to create them manually.

In fact, Karma configurations are already an integral part of the core of an Angular project.

In the root of your Angular project, you can create your `karma.conf.js` with this content :

    // Karma configuration file, see link for more information
    // https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/configuration-file.html
    
    module.exports = function (config) {
      config.set({
        basePath: '',
        frameworks: ['jasmine', '@angular-devkit/build-angular'],
        plugins: [
          require('karma-jasmine'),
          require('karma-chrome-launcher'),
          require('karma-jasmine-html-reporter'),
          require('karma-coverage'),
          require('@angular-devkit/build-angular/plugins/karma')
        ],
        client: {
          jasmine: {
            // you can add configuration options for Jasmine here
            // the possible options are listed at https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/Configuration.html
            // for example, you can disable the random execution with `random: false`
            // or set a specific seed with `seed: 4321`
          },
          clearContext: false // leave Jasmine Spec Runner output visible in browser
        },
        jasmineHtmlReporter: {
          suppressAll: true // removes the duplicated traces
        },
        coverageReporter: {
          dir: require('path').join(__dirname, './coverage/ngv'),
          subdir: '.',
          reporters: [
            { type: 'html' },
            { type: 'text-summary' }
          ]
        },
        reporters: ['progress', 'kjhtml'],
        port: 9876,
        colors: true,
        logLevel: config.LOG_INFO,
        autoWatch: true,
        browsers: ['Chrome'],
        singleRun: false,
        restartOnFileChange: true
      });
    };`
    
And then, in your `src` folder, you can create `test.ts` file with this content :

    // This file is required by karma.conf.js and loads recursively all the .spec and framework files 
    import 'zone.js/testing';
    import { getTestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
    import {
      BrowserDynamicTestingModule,
      platformBrowserDynamicTesting
    } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic/testing';
    
    declare const require: {
      context(path: string, deep?: boolean, filter?: RegExp): {
        keys(): string[];
        <T>(id: string): T;
      };
    };
    
    // First, initialize the Angular testing environment.
    getTestBed().initTestEnvironment(
      BrowserDynamicTestingModule,
      platformBrowserDynamicTesting(), {
        teardown: { destroyAfterEach: false }
    }
    );
    // Then we find all the tests.
    const context = require.context('./', true, /\.spec\.ts$/);
    // And load the modules.
    context.keys().map(context);

Finally, you'll update your `angular.json` file about the test section like that to configure the usage of Karma's custom configuration file:

    "test": {
              ...
              "options": {
                "main": "src/test.ts",
                ...
                **"karmaConfig": "karma.conf.js"**,
                ...
              },
      	...
      }
